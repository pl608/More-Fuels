More-Fuels is a mod adds a few new fuels for use in furnaces and vehicles.
The oil can (not the oil bucket) is only added when [Technic](https://content.luanti.org/packages/RealBadAngel/technic/) is installed, though it isnt necessary, its only added to be more realistic.

Note that compatibility with the [Hidroplane](https://content.luanti.org/packages/apercy/hidroplane/), [Motorboat](https://content.luanti.org/packages/apercy/motorboat/), and [Trike](https://content.luanti.org/packages/apercy/trike/) mods by [APercy](https://content.luanti.org/users/apercy/) are complete.

### WIP Fuels

##### Code Inspectors:
say thanks to Techdude, he was the one to organize this mod into multiple, easily readable/editable, files.(something of which I am generally incapable)
